In part 3 using SDSoC we create the enviroment for the accelarator, choosing the data transfer protocol for the Zedboard
in order to achive maximum efficiency.

After creating the image using the SDSoC, we tested the accelarator in the Zedboard and achieved a 22mil throughput, out of 25mil that is the theoretical
value for the accelarator dimension = 4.

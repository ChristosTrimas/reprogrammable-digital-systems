In the second phase of part 2 we use Vivado HLS and its directives to design the architecture of our Accelarator.
The function passes C simulation, C/RTL cosimulation succesfully and there are no errors in terms of correctness.
You can check the C synthesis results in the report in part 4 in the last section.
